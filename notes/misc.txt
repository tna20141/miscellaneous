MISCELLANEOUS NOTES
===================

Changing EIP: gcc won't allow, Internet says it can't be changed arbitrarily by programers (only
through instructions like jmp), but it can be set manually in gdb.

----------------

When executing a script (or a program, I suppose), the "./" or current directory will be the
current executing directory, not the executable file's directory.

----------------

General rsync command:
rsync -avs --delete [--dry-run] -r <user@host:absolute_path> <dest_local_path>

----------------

csrf checking is actually carried out by browsers

----------------

Fcitx - unikey:
To make it work, I did the following:
- make sure related modules are installed (like fcitx-frontend-gtk3)
- remove all the existing *_IM_MODULE environment variables pointing to ibus and point them to fcitx instead
	For now, they are put in ~/.xprofile
- make it smoother
	Enable the macro in im tray menu (and in unikey) to type vietnamese better (like giá intead of gía)
	Change Unikey method's keyboard layout to Vietnamese to stop it being the default for new windows
		(this only works for firefox!)
	Global Config -> Default Input Method State -> Inactive: solves the problem

----------------

i3 & destop:
X Windows --> Window Manager (i3) --> Desktop Environment (Gnome/KDE)
	(i3's DE seems to be named i3 as well, or it doesn't have one)
Put all the startup commands (nm-applet, fcitx...) to i3/config
default apps in ~/.config/mimeapps.list (Under [Default Applications])
for firefox, the other apps are okay but I have to uninstall nautilus for it to choose thunar
screen size is not a multiple of line height -> some terminal programs (like vim) don't fill the whole window
switch horizontal then vertical mode (or opposite) to create a new container level
to move out of the parent container, just "move" it out there
