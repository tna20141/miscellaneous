Notes for ssh
=============

- Fingerprint is a hash of public key. It's permanent (as long as the public key doesnt change).
- Fingerprint is for client to authenticate (quite manually) server.
- Fuzzy fingerprint is a technique aiming at laziness when it comes to manual verification.
- Client stores public keys of accepted hosts in ~/.ssh/known_hosts for later regconition.
- Public & private keys of server can be found in /etc/ssh/. The file format is ASN1 BER/DER
	encoded then base64 encoded.
- ~/.ssh/authorized_keys is for server to authenticate clients. It contains the public keys of 
	clients that the server authorizes (clients need to store their private keys in ~/.ssh).
	This can be used to implement password-less login. Note that ~/.ssh/authorized_keys needs
	to be WRITABLE by OWNER AND ROOT ONLY for this to work.

- some options: -p [port] for remote port, -b [bind_addr] to use a local address as source address
	(useful if local has more than 1 address).

ssh tunneling: ssh -L [bind_addr:]port:remote_host:remote_port
- bind_addr: default (not specified) is GatewayPorts in ssh config. If is "localhost", listening
	port is for local use only. If is empty or "*", listening port is available from all
	interfaces.
- example: ssh -f user@remote1 -L 9876:remote2:25 -N. 'remote1' is the remote end of the tunnel
	while 'remote2' is the service provider (whatever it is). If remote1 and remote2 are the
	same then you can just specify remote2 as 'localhost'.

SSHFS: (sftp && fuse)
- useful command:
sshfs -o allow_other -o reconnect -o ServerAliveInterval=5 [user@]host:[dir] /mnt/point
- other options: -o kernel_cache -o auto_cache -o cache_timeout=100
