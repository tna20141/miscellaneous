some notes about file/directory permissions:

removing a file only requires having write (and execute) permissions on the parent directory (if file is not writable rm will ask if the user wants to remove write-protected file)
changing directory's content (rename, add file, remove file) requires bot write and execute permissions on the directory
read permission on a directory only allows listing file names in that directory
(only) execute permission on directories is required to access their files (read, write, execute)
changing a file's permission doesn't count as changing the parent directory's content
sticky bit is ignored on files
sticky bit on a directory prevents users from deleting or renaming the files, unless the user is the owner of the directory, the owner of the file of the superuser
on many systems, setuid and setgid bits work with executable files don't work with script files (for security purposes)
12 permission bits: (setuid setgid stickybit) (rwx for user) (rwx for group) (rwx for other)
