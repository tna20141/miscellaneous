---------------------------

container's filesystem persists even after stopped and restarted

You have to have COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME right. It defaults to cwd basename, so it works in yr.
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=yr docker-compose <the rest>

docker-compose up doesn't seem to rebuild images (it worked once I think, but not really sure)

bash -c "<cmd>" to execute complicated commands

docker-compose run spawn a new container everytime run (image is not rebuilt)

docker-compose DOWN removes containers, so be careful. Use STOP instead.

to clean up docker:
- remove all dangling images with:
docker images -q --filter "dangling=true" | xargs docker rmi
- remove ALL STOPPED CONTIANERS with:
docker rm `docker ps --no-trunc -aq`
(WARNING: be careful. Containers have changes that should be preserved)
- remove the useless images with:
docker rmi <imageid>
(this may be changed positively in the future)
