MISCELLANEOUS NOTES
===================

Changing EIP: gcc won't allow, Internet says it can't be changed arbitrarily by programers (only
through instructions like jmp), but it can be set manually in gdb.

----------------

When executing a script (or a program, I suppose), the "./" or current directory will be the
current executing directory, not the executable file's directory.
